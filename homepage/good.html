                    <h3>Who Am I?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Hello, my name is Logan Vaughan, and I am a Computer Software Engineering Co-op student at the University of Alberta.
                        I'll be graduating in April this year, and I'm excited to be joining the workforce as a full-time software developer.
                        I love developing web applications with the latest technologies and frameworks,
                        and I am constantly learning new techniques to improve my skills.

                    <h3>Professional History</h3>
                    <p>
                        Over the last couple years, I have gained web development experience through my internships and personal projects.
                        In my most recent internship, I worked as a student software developer for a local software development company.
                        In this role, I worked with a team of full-time software developers,
                        and I was responsible for developing front-end and back-end components for our web applications.
                        My most recent personal project was an Among Us clone that I made last year using Node, Phaser, and Socket.io.
